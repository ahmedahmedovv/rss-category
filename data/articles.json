Since 2022, Polish foreign policy and diplomacy have been primarily focused on Eastern Europe and issues directly or indirectly linked to the Russian-Ukrainian war. This focus was evident in the 2024 policy address by Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, where other global regions (apart from the Indo-Pacific) were mentioned only briefly. However, in competing with Moscow, it is crucial to engage partners located thousands of kilometers away from Warsaw. Morocco, the most pro-Western country in North Africa, is one such partner.",
